React meanings:

Components: User interface part that it is independable and I can reuse it
    Each component will have an "State" that is unique from another component, I can reuse that component
    Component = "A block"

    Components will have different cathegories, but, the primaries would be:
        FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS and CLASS COMPONENTS, I'm going to be working with "Functional"

        FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS: A JavaScript function that return a React element.
            The component function should start with a Mayusc Letter = function Hello(props){return instructions}
            It can receive parameters ("props") = "Properties" are arguments that a React component can receive
            We can have Components inside another Comoponent, 1 component could receive a Prop, so basically a Prop is an Object,
                with that object we can use their properties
            Props can only be send from the father class as inheritance 

        Class Component: This would be ES6 that just return a JSX element
                Their sintaxys is different:
                    It needs to extend a React.Component
                    It needs to have a Render() method to return the JSX element
                    It can receive values if it is need it

                    I have to use "this", it means that specifically component or prop that I would be able to use
                
State: JavaScript representantion about set of properties from a component and their current values

Hooks: I can add/assing/update a state to a functional component 

Event Listener/Handler: JavaScript function that is executed when a specific event occurs

JSX = .jsx means React extension for JavaScript sintaxys
    It led me to describe in JavaScript how a component would be displayed using an HTML-like structure.

In JSX appear an Element, an Element is different that a Component
    A "Component" is a element combination
    Element: It is just 1 piece from React
        With an Element from a JSX I can use whatever from HTML:
            <div>, <img>, so on

DOM (Document Object Model) = Web representation from all the elements that make up a website or app

Class from HTML = className in JSX
for from HTML = htmlFor in JSX

To use "CSS" on JS we have to create a JSX, I'mg going to create a "const" from JS but in ther "{}" I will add the "CSS code"

If we use "{}" means that we are using JS, so, I can create a "var" from JS and then I would be able to use it in the JSX file inside the "{}"
